# SimpleApp

This is a sample application that uses
[`SimpleGeo.framework`](https://github.com/simplegeo/SimpleGeo.framework). It
also serves as a stand-alone API explorer that allows editing of data in
SimpleGeo Places.

You can [download a snapshot](https://github.com/simplegeo/SimpleApp/downloads)
to avoid having to build it yourself.
